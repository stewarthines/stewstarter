# Stew's Starter Pack

*Stewart Hines | October 2015*

This is my starter pack. Just combining a lot of things that I've learned to make my own framework. The purpose of the framework is to be a starting point for future project. So, this is not an end in and of it's self. Let's take a quick look at what's inside!

### Basic Files and wishlist
- [x] My own very own **Reset.sass** file that's [based off a tutorial from TUTS+](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-create-your-own-simple-resetcss-file--net-206)
- [x] A Typographic based vertical spacing system from [Gridlvoer](http://www.gridlover.net/app/)
- [x] 11 Shades of Gray. Not 50. [From Viget](https://viget.com/inspire/shades-of-gray-yes-really)
- [x] Good Contrast for my text, backgrounds, and borders. [Thanks Colorable](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/)
- [ ] A very simple (responsive) Flexbox based Block Grid system. It makes blocks.
- [ ] Basic Forms
- [ ] Basic Buttons
- [ ] Simple Global Responsive Header
- [ ] Optional *"sticky"* header
- [ ] Dropdowns for the header
- [ ] Consistent look and feel / art style

### Nerdy Code Stuff
- [x] .SASS based styles instead of.SCSS or .LESS [(Thanks @DevTips!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z3qznaE9vc)
- [x] Gulp!
- [x] Auto compile my SASS - [Gulp Sass baby.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass)
- [x] Use [gulp-autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer)
- [ ] Auto refresh the browser
- [ ] Auto compress images
- [ ] Angularjs Based
- [ ] As semantic as I know how to get the HTML
